## Introduction
Tamandua is a debugger from scratch project. It is initially intended for me to learn more about binaries,
how they work, and understand the magic that are modern day debuggers.
Currently most of the code is a Rust implementation of the [TartanLlama's debugger series] (https://blog.tartanllama.xyz/writing-a-linux-debugger-setup/)
(highly recommended) to get off the ground . But the vision goes beyond that.
